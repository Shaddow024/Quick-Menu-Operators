# Quick-Menu-Operators
These Operators are made to add some more usefull utility to the Blender addon Quick Menu.

The included operators are:

-The slice boolean:
  a lot like the slice boolean from the bool tool but with added funkionality, like moving the modifier to the top or creating a collection for all the cutters
  
-The inset boolean:
  it behaves a bit like a slice boolean, but the region gets inseted
  
-Show all cutters:
  Shows all objects cutting the selected objects.
  
-Hide all cutters:
  Hide all objects that are involved in boolean operations
  
-Apply all Modifiers:
  This will apply all modifiers based on their type for the selected objects.
