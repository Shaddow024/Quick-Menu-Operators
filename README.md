# Quick-Menu-Operators
These Operators are made to add some more usefull utility to the Blender addon Quick Menu by Passivestar.

To acces all of the features you have to download the zip file above, unzip it and install the addon like any other addon and after that you have to click the edit 
button of the quick menu and find the location of that json file.
After you found the normal json file you have to swap it with the json file that is contained in the zip.
The Quick Menu itself:

and how to customize the operatoes yourself:

The included operators are:

-The slice boolean:
  It works a lot like the slice boolean from the bool tool but with added funkionality, like moving the modifier to the top or creating a collection for all the cutters.

-The inset boolean:
  It behaves a bit like a slice boolean, but the region gets inseted.

  Shows all objects cutting the selected objects.
  
-Hide all cutters:
  Hide all objects that are involved in boolean operations
  
-Apply all Modifiers:
  This will apply all modifiers based on their type for the selected objects.
